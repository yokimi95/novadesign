// Wire contract between the in-app experience survey and its PostHog record.
//
// The survey is `type: api` in PostHog: PostHog stores and analyses the
// responses, but renders nothing — `ExperienceSurvey` owns the UI so the card
// follows the app's material, theme and all 19 locales. That split means the
// client is responsible for emitting the survey events in the shape PostHog's
// survey analytics expects, which is what this module encodes.
//
// The ids below are the PostHog survey's own. They are stable once created, so
// hard-coding them keeps the client free of a fetch-before-render round trip.
//
//   Survey: https://us.posthog.com/project/420348/surveys/01a00fd1-ed7e-0000-d38e-63bce21fb816
//
// EDITING THE QUESTIONS IN POSTHOG REGENERATES NOTHING HERE. If a question is
// added, removed or reordered there, update this file in the same change or
// responses will land under the wrong question id.
